## How to Add Media Locations?
1. Press **CTRL + S** or click on **[Settings]** button to Open Settings UI.
2. Go to **File** Tab.
3. Under **Media Locations**, click on **[Add]** button and navigate to the directory where your movie files are located. <br>

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** First-time loading of App takes a while to finish. Even longer if you have a huge collection of media files. <br>

### NOTES for Adding TV Series
  - Located under **Series Locations**.
  - The directory **must be** the top-level *base* folder.
  - A sample directory structure:
```
D:\TV Series\Title of Series and Season\Episode 1.mp4
```
  - With this structure, ``D:\TV Series`` is your base folder.
