## What is Home Cinema?

**Home Cinema** is a *"media cataloguing software"*.

Organize your collection of Movies and TV shows with HomeCinema.

It is like a book catalogue, except it's for Movies and Series located in your Local Drive.

Ease the pain of browsing through many folders and finding out which movie is which.

### NOTES for Adding TV Series
